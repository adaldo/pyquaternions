# pyquaternions
My own implementation of quaternions in Python

## Installation
For now, just clone the repository in your project.

## Usage
Simply `import quaternion.py`.

## Uninstall
- Remove the repository from your computer.
- Write me a mail and let me know what went wrong.

## Why yet another Python quaternion module?
There already exists a plethora of Python modules for quaternions on Github.
In addition, there already exits a plethora of Python modules on Pypy that support quaternions.
I built this module to educate myself, and to give myself exactly the functionalities that I needed.
