# pyquaternions
My implementation of quaternions in python

## Installation
For now, just clone the repository in your project.

## Usage
Simply `import quaternion.py`.
I have included two test files with a consensus algorithm, but the usage of `quaternion.py` is general and not specific to consensus problems.
Run `test.py` to see a graphical animation.
Run `multiple_runs.py` to run a hundred simulations with randomly generated initial conditions.

## Uninstall
- Remove the repository from your computer.
- Write me a mail and let me know what went wrong.
